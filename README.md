Practical recipes for building real-world Azure Functions with Python.

## Why Use It

Starting a new Azure Functions project often means piecing together scattered documentation,
blog posts, and sample code. This cookbook provides curated, runnable recipes that answer:

- What should I build for this scenario?
- How should the architecture look?
- How do I start from a working baseline?

## Scope

- Azure Functions Python **v2 programming model**
- Decorator-based `func.FunctionApp()` applications
- Practical recipes with runnable examples
- Architecture explanations and production notes

This repository is content-first. It is not a CLI tool.
