## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes (e.g., changing the recipe contract).
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner (e.g., adding a new recipe).
3. PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes or documentation improvements.

For a documentation-first project like this, "breaking changes" often refer to significant restructuring of the repository or changes to the required metadata for recipes that would break existing integrations or automation.

## Release Process

Our release process is designed to be transparent and automated:

1. Changes are proposed via Pull Requests.
2. Automated CI checks must pass, including tests, linting, and security scans.
3. Once merged to the main branch, a new version is prepared.
4. A GitHub release is created with a version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
5. The documentation site is automatically updated to reflect the new release.

Each release includes a summary of changes, categorized as Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed, to help users understand what is new and what has changed since the previous version.

## Contributing to the Changelog

Contributors are encouraged to update the [Unreleased] section of the changelog when submitting a Pull Request. This makes it easier for maintainers to compile the final release notes. Please follow the format established in this file.

1. Ensure the change is categorized correctly (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed).
2. Keep descriptions concise but informative.
3. Reference relevant issues or pull requests where applicable.

By maintaining a clear and detailed changelog, we ensure that the project remains accessible and understandable for all users and contributors.
