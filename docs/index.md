# Azure Functions Python Cookbook

Practical, production-oriented patterns for building Azure Functions with the
Python v2 programming model.

!!! info "What this project is"
    This repository is a cookbook and pattern catalog.
    It is not a runtime library you install as application dependency.

## Why this cookbook exists

Azure Functions documentation is broad, but many teams still need concrete,
copy-adapt-run patterns for common workloads. This cookbook focuses on that
gap by pairing clear pattern narratives with runnable examples.

## What you get

- **67 patterns** across 13 categories covering APIs, messaging, orchestration, AI, and more
- **67 runnable example projects** under `examples/`, organized by category
- **Bicep and Terraform IaC templates** for most recipes
- Production considerations in every pattern
- Mermaid architecture and behavior diagrams
- Integration with the Azure Functions Python DX Toolkit

!!! tip
    The fastest path to value is: pick one pattern, run its example, then adapt
    for your production constraints.
