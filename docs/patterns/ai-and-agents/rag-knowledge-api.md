# RAG Knowledge API

> **Trigger**: HTTP | **State**: stateless | **Guarantee**: request-response | **Difficulty**: intermediate | **Showcase**: Knowledge Toolkit

## Overview
This recipe builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API on Azure Functions
using `azure-functions-knowledge-python`.

The function app exposes two HTTP endpoints:

- `POST /api/ask` — embed a question, retrieve matching knowledge chunks, and
  synthesize an answer.
- `POST /api/ingest` — submit new documents to the knowledge base for indexing.

The example also layers in `azure-functions-validation-python`,
`azure-functions-openapi-python`, and `azure-functions-logging-python` so the API has schema
validation, generated contracts, and structured telemetry.

## When to Use
- You want a thin serverless API in front of a vector-backed knowledge base.
- You need a simple RAG entry point without building the retrieval pipeline by hand.
- You want request validation and OpenAPI docs alongside AI endpoints.

## When NOT to Use
- You need long-running ingestion or document enrichment pipelines better handled asynchronously.
- You need durable multi-turn agent state instead of one request producing one grounded answer.
- You want to hand-tune every embedding, retrieval, and prompt orchestration step yourself.

## Integration Matrix
| Toolkit | Role in this recipe |
| --- | --- |
| `azure-functions-knowledge-python` | Embedding, vector search, context assembly, and answer generation |
| `azure-functions-validation-python` | Validates `/ask` and `/ingest` request bodies and response models |
| `azure-functions-openapi-python` | Describes the API contract for client discovery and testing |
| `azure-functions-logging-python` | Adds structured logs for question, retrieval, and ingestion activity |

- `azure-functions-openapi-python`
- `azure-functions-logging-python`
- Azure AI Search and an LLM/embedding endpoint configured via environment variables

## Implementation
The example keeps the RAG surface area small and centered on the toolkit.

```python
try:
    from azure_functions_knowledge import KnowledgeClient
except ImportError:
    KnowledgeClient = None


def _create_knowledge_client() -> object:
    if KnowledgeClient is None:
        return _FallbackKnowledgeClient()
    return KnowledgeClient(
        search_endpoint=os.getenv("AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT"),
        search_index=os.getenv("AI_SEARCH_INDEX"),
        search_api_key=os.getenv("AI_SEARCH_API_KEY"),
        openai_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
        openai_api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        chat_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT"),
        embedding_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT"),
    )
```

Use the canonical decorator order for HTTP recipes in this repo:

```python
@app.route(route="ask", methods=["POST"])
@with_context
@openapi(...)
@validate_http(...)
def ask(...):
    ...
```

`/ask` forwards the request into the RAG pipeline and returns grounded output.

```python
result = client.ask(
    question=body.question,
    top_k=body.top_k,
    metadata_filter=body.metadata_filter,
)
```

`/ingest` accepts a batch of documents and passes them to the knowledge store.

```python
result = client.ingest_documents(
    [document.model_dump() for document in body.documents]
)
```

## Behavior

    participant Client
    participant API as Azure Function
    participant Knowledge as KnowledgeClient
    participant Search as Vector Search
    participant LLM as Chat Model

    Client->>API: POST /api/ask { question }
    API->>Knowledge: ask(question, top_k, metadata_filter)
    Knowledge->>Search: embed + search
    Search-->>Knowledge: relevant chunks
    Knowledge->>LLM: prompt with retrieved context
    LLM-->>Knowledge: grounded answer
    Knowledge-->>API: answer + citations
    API-->>Client: 200 JSON response
```

## Run Locally
```bash
cd examples/ai-and-agents/rag_knowledge_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp local.settings.json.example local.settings.json
func start
```

## Expected Output
```text
Functions:

    ask:    [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/ask
    ingest: [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/ingest
```

Example ask request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "How does Azure Functions scale?", "top_k": 3}'
```

```json
{
  "answer": "Azure Functions scales automatically by adding compute instances when request volume increases.",
  "citations": [
    {
      "id": "doc-1",
      "title": "Azure Functions overview",
      "chunk": "Azure Functions automatically scales based on demand."
    }
  ],
  "matches": 1
}
```

## Production Considerations
- Authentication: use `FUNCTION` or stronger auth in production; `ANONYMOUS` is for local demos.
- Ingestion: large document imports should move to queue-backed or durable workflows.
- Retrieval quality: tune chunk size, `top_k`, filters, and embedding model selection to your corpus.
- Observability: log question length, result count, latency, and fallback mode without logging sensitive prompts verbatim.
- Secrets: prefer managed identity or Key Vault-backed configuration over raw API keys.
