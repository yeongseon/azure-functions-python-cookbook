# Recipes

Practical recipes for building real-world Azure Functions with Python v2.
Each recipe is paired with a runnable project in `examples/`.

!!! tip
    Read the recipe, then run the matching example.
    Every example includes a `function_app.py` ready for `func start`.

## How to Choose

Pick by your primary trigger:

1. **Synchronous request/response** &rarr; HTTP recipes
2. **Scheduled execution** &rarr; Timer recipe
3. **Async message processing** &rarr; Queue or Service Bus recipes
4. **Event streaming** &rarr; Event Hub recipe
5. **File processing** &rarr; Blob recipes
6. **Change data capture** &rarr; Cosmos DB recipe
7. **Multi-step workflows** &rarr; Durable Functions recipes
8. **AI tool serving** &rarr; MCP Server recipe

Then refine with patterns:

- Need **modular code** &rarr; Blueprint Modular App
- Need **managed identity** &rarr; Identity recipes
- Need **performance tuning** &rarr; host.json or Concurrency recipes
- Need **reliability** &rarr; Retry & Idempotency
